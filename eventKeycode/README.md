# Keycode Info

This project displays the key, keycode and event code whenever a key is pressed on the keyboard

## How It's Made:

Uses a keydown listener on the window to display info dynamically
**Tech used:**
HTML, CSS, JavaScript
**Preview:**

<div align="center">
  <img src="./assets/keycodeInfo.gif" alt="Preview of keyCode Info" />  
</div>

## Optimizations:

It would be fun to come back and hardcode a keyboard into the html that highlights the key pressed as well as provides the keycode at the top

## Lessons Learned:

More work on event listeners and working with the window
