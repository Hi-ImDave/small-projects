# Split Landing

This is an example of a split landing page. Could be used to direct visitors to different versions of a site based on their needs.

## How It's Made:

Mostly done with CSS, minimal JS for hover events.
**Tech used:**
HTML, CSS, JavaScript
**Preview:**

<div align="center">
  <img src="./assets/splitLanding.gif" alt="preview of split landing" />  
</div>

## Optimizations:

Not sure I like the final zoom in of the image on transition, would probably get rid of that

## Lessons Learned:

More work on pseudo selectors and how the ::before selector works.
