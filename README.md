# small-projects
This is a collection of small projects that are intended to be incorporated into larger projects. The purpose of this collection is to improve basic CSS and JS skills.


## How It's Made:
I will be adding one project a day (5 per week minimum) to this collection until I run out.
Includes a template folder that all projects will be started from with basic HTML and CSS layout.

**Tech used:** 
All projects will use vanilla JavaScript, CSS and HTML. 

**Top Projects:**

<div align="center">
  <img src="expandingCards/assets/expandingCards.gif" alt="cards being expanded and collapsed" />  
</div>


## Optimizations:
As projects are added to this repository I will update the <u>Top Projects</u> section to reflect my favorite projects I have worked on. Will be limited to 4 projects maximum
