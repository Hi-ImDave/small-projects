# Rotating Navigation
This is a navigation menu that rotates on click. Can be used for a number of projects to show off your CSS skills.


## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** 
HTML, CSS, JavaScript

**Preview:**

<div align="center">
  <img src="./assets/rotatingNav.gif" alt="clicking nav function" />  
</div>


## Optimizations:
I would more style to background, maybe use a picture for the underlying bg. Add links to the nav menu

## Lessons Learned:
Learned how to use CSS translate and transform a little bit better. Also good practice for targeting specific selectors without adding multiple classes or ids to everything
