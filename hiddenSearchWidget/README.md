# Hidden Search Widget
This is a search bar that is hidden/exposed until the icon is clicked. This project is mostly CSS with very minimal JS

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** 
HTML, CSS, JavaScript

**Preview:**

<div align="center">
  <img src="./assets/hiddenSearch.gif" alt="clicking hidden search" />  
</div>

## Optimizations
I would clean up the transition a bit more. You can still see the squared edges for a split second when opening/closing search bar
